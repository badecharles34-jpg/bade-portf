// Fix: Removed problematic triple-slash directives to resolve type definition errors.
// These types are expected to be included via tsconfig.json. The reference to
// 'next/image-types/global' is outdated in recent Next.js versions.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
